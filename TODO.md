# TODO

- [ ] Add progress indicators/status polling for long GPT runs.
- [ ] Persist completed analyses for later download/history.
- [ ] Offer alternative output formats (CSV/JSON) alongside `.txt`.
- [ ] Expand failure-mode tests (network errors, bad files, oversized chunks).
- [ ] Evaluate migrating from `PyPDF2` to the actively maintained `pypdf` package.
